15.4.2 Rules for the Civil Use of the Gregorian Calendar

The Gregorian calendar uses the same months with the numbers of days
as it predecessor, the Julian calendar (see Table 15.5). Days are
counted from the first day of each month. Years are counted from the
initial epoch defined by Dionysius Exiguus (see ยง 15.1.8), and each
begins on January 1. A common year has 365 days but a leap year has
366, with an intercalary day, designated February 29, preceding March
1. Leap years are determined according to the following rule:

  Every year that is exactly divisible by 4 is a leap year, except for
  years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years
  are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

As a result,  the year 2000 was a leap year, whereas 1900 and 2100 are
not.

The epoch of the Gregorian calendar, (1 January 1) was Monday, 1
January 3 in the Julian calendar or Julian Day Number 1721426.

The algorithm's for ymd2day and day2ymd are based off of.
